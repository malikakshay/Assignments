HTML Tags
HTML tags are like keywords which defines that how web browser will format and display the content. With the help of tags, a web browser can distinguish between an HTML content and a simple content.

HTML Elements

An HTML file is made of elements. These elements are responsible for creating web pages and define content in that webpage. An element in HTML usually consist of a start tag <tag name>, close tag </tag name> and content inserted between them. Technically, an element is a collection of start tag, attributes, end tag, content between them.
Example:<!DOCTYPE html>  
<html>  
<head>  
    <title>WebPage</title>  
</head>  
<body>  
   <h1>This is my first web page</h1>  
    <h2> How it looks?</h2>  
     <p>It looks Nice!!!!!</p>  
</body>  
</html>  

HTML Attribute
HTML attributes are special words which provide additional information about the elements or attributes are the modifier of the HTML element.
Each element or tag can have attributes, which defines the behaviour of that element.
Attributes should always be applied with start tag.
The Attribute should always be applied with its name and value pair.
The Attributes name and values are case sensitive, and it is recommended by W3C that it should be written in Lowercase only.
You can add multiple attributes in one HTML element, but need to give space between two attributes.
Example:<!DOCTYPE html>  
<html>  
<head>  
</head>  
<body>  
    <h1> This is Style attribute</h1>  
   <p style="height: 50px; color: blue">It will add style property in element</p>  
    <p style="color: red">It will change the color of content</p>  
</body>  
</html>
