 List out any 3 tags we learned in this module and give a brief expanation about the tags

HTML Heading:
A HTML heading or HTML h tag can be defined as a title or a subtitle which you want to display on the webpage. When you place the text within the heading tags <h1>.........</h1>, it is displayed on the browser in the bold format and size of the text depends on the number of heading.

HTML Paragraph:
HTML paragraph or HTML p tag is used to define a paragraph in a webpage. Let's take a simple example to see how it work. It is a notable point that a browser itself add an empty line before and after a paragraph. An HTML <p> tag indicates starting of new paragraph.

HTML Div Tag:
The HTML <div> tag is used to group the large section of HTML elements together.

We know that every tag has a specific purpose e.g. p tag is used to specify paragraph, <h1> to <h6> tag are used to specify headings but the <div> tag is just like a container unit which is used to encapsulate other page elements and divides the HTML documents into sections.
