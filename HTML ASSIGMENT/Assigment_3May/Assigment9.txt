 What are self-closing tags Write a brief note on meta tags

 A self-closing tag in HTML is a kind of HTML tag that does not need to be closed manually by its closing tag, which means it does not have a separate closing tag as </tag>. Some few self-closing tags are <input/>, <hr/>, <br/>, <img/>, etc.
