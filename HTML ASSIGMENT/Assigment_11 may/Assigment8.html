    <dd>What is meant by full stack development? Full stack development is the end-to-end development of applications. It includes both the front end and back end of an application. The front end is usually accessed by a client, and the back end forms the core of the application where all the business logic is applied.</dd>
    <dt>Tech Stack</dt>
    <dd>A stack is an arrangement of “things” kept in order one over the other. A technology stack is a set of technologies that are stacked together to build any application. Popularly known as a technology infrastructure or solutions stack, technology stack has become essential for building easy-to-maintain, scalable web applications.

        Technology stack determines the type of applications you can build, the level of customizations you can perform, and the resources you need to develop your application.
        
        For example, a web tech stack typically looks like:</dd>
